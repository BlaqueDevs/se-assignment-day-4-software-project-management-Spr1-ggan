# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
> Budget control. software projects that lag too long in development leads to increased costs as a result of extended use of resources.
> Customer satisfaction. Delays leads to customers choosing another software and this may lead to loss of a large portion of the intended market.
> Competitive advantage over potential competitors as a result of being ahead in providing customers with their needs.
> Improving team morale. Extensive delays leads to frustrations from investors and developers that may result in sub standard projects.
> Regulatory expectations. Some projects may be mandated by the government to be completed within a specified period of time.
STRATEGIES TO ENSURE DEADLINES ARE MET
> Clear scope definition. Team members should know th project in its entirety and avoid unnecessary scope creep.
> Agile methodology to ensure work is brokend down into sprints making it flexible to all developers.
> Prioritization of tasks based on their urgencies to ensure essential works are done earlier.
> Using tracking tools such as Trello, Jira and Asana ensuring the project is on schedule.
> Regualar communications and updates from developers.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control on software projects ensures that the project is delivered on time, within the expected budget and ensures customer satisfaction with the final product. It prevents project delays leading to it going over budget and as a result produces a software of a lower quality than that which was intended.
STRATEGIES
> Having a clear project scope while also avoiding unnecessary scope creep.
> Accurate estimation. Data from previuos similar projects to be used in order to have a sensible timeline on when the project is expected to be completed.
> Using Agile methodology. This ensures that work continues on a regualr basis as it focuses on small manageable tasks.
> Budget monitoring tools such as Trello and Jira to ensure at each given time the project is within budget.
> Automate testing. Reduces manual testing costs and avoid expensive late-stage bug fixes.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology is a flexible approach where projects are broken into small cycles (sprints), allowing for continuous development, feedback, and improvement.
KEY FEATURES
> Work is divided into manageable tasks (sprints)
> Regular feedback from stakeholders.
> Changes and updates are made throughout the project.
 ADVANTAGES
> Adaptable to changing requirements
> Regular feedback ensures customer satisfaction
> Bugs are detected early and fixed avoiding problems in the final product.
DISADVANTAGES
> It is hard to have a clear budget estimate as updates are made in cases of changing requirements.
> Needs continuous customer interaction and involvement.
> Focus is on working software rather than detailed documentation.
Waterfall methodology is where one step of a project ends before another begins. It has a sequential approach to it.
KEY FEATURES
> Development follows a structured step-by-step process
> Extensive planning and documentation before development starts
ADVANTAGES
> Each phase is well-defined, making project management easier.
> Best for fixed-budget projects.
> Helps with future maintenance and onboarding new developers.
DISADVANTAGES
> Hard to accommodate changes once development begins.
> If a requirement was misunderstood early, fixing it later is costly.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
CASES OF AGILE BEING SUITABLE
> When projects have changing requirements
> When the projects require regular tests and feedback
EXAMPLES
> Developing a new mobile app
> Developing a new online shopping platform such as Jumia
CASES OF WATERFALL BEING SUITABLE
> When the project has clearly defined requirements
> When the budget for the project is fixed.
EXAMPLES
> Government software such as tax filing app or website
> Banking systems
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
> Having a clearly defined quality requirements
> Continuous testing to ensure that quality is up to standard
> Code reviews by other developers
> Bug detection and monitoring systems.
IMPORTANCE
> Avoiding security issues and bug crashes.
> Avoiding high repair costs as a result of poor work done earlier.
> Avoiding project delays leading to unsatisfied customers
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project scope defines the boundaries, deliverables, objectives, and constraints of a project.
> Avoids budget overrun.
> Identifies potential challenges within the project.
> Ensures all parties are in agreement on the project.
> Avoiding uncontrolled and unnecessary changes to the project.
Work breakdown structure is a hierarchical breakdown of a project into smaller, manageable tasks. It visually represents the project scope and helps in planning, scheduling, and resource allocation.
> Breaks down complex projects into manageable parts.
>  Assigns the right people to each task.
>  Helps foresee challenges in smaller tasks rather than large deliverables
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
> Determines what needs to be done and in what order.
> Identifies potential delays and enables contingency planning.
> Improves accountability by assigning obligations to team members
> Keeps everyone informed about project progress.
A gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart used in project management to visually represent a project over time.
> By displaying task start/end dates, duration, and completion status, it helps in tracking project progress.
> Shows which tasks must be completed before others start.
> Highlighting key deliverables and deadlines.
> Allows a flexible approach to allow tasks to be rescheduled when necessary.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My software aims to address the issue of errors experienced during manual data entry. The errors mainly may stem from human error during entry of data. 
Reduce costs that companies incurr as a result of needeing to hiring many data entrants.
Increasing efficiency by ensuring that work is completed within the least amount of time possible.
> Saves firms cost of hiring extensive manpower.
> Reduces errors in data entry ensuring smooth workflow.
> Saves time wasted when processing large chunks of data .
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
> Focuses developmental efforts on the source of the customer dissatisfaction.
> Helps all stakeholders involved in the project from investors to developers be aligned and be on the same pages.
> Ensures proper allocation of resources based on its urgency and importance to the overall scope of te project.
> Customer and user prioritization and this helps to centre the development of the software solution with the customer in mind.
> Heps in setting goals and how realistic they are to achieve.
